  - The wire-weekly-digest-pipeline task (commit c29c088c) succeeded by importing
    and calling an existing WeeklyDigestFormatter rather than building new functionality.
    The +44 LOC change across 3 files was small, focused, and delivered real working
    code. Integration-style tasks that wire existing components have a much higher
    success rate than greenfield implementation tasks in this project.

    try cleaned summary, then task_description, then synthesize from structured metadata
    (tool names with counts, session duration, tags), and finally fall back to project
    name. Each level produces progressively less specific but still useful content,
    ensuring no narrative is ever empty or contains raw artifacts.'

  - 'QA agent (Codex) provided two rounds of precise, actionable feedback: Round 1
    identified that measurers should run CLI and parse generated files (not format
    sessions directly) and flagged timestamp field mismatches. Round 2 caught a spec
    mismatch (task_description checking always-present marker instead of actual content)
    and environment issues. Dev fixed both rounds quickly (9 minutes and 4 minutes
    respectively). The specificity of QA feedback (exact field names, exact test commands,
    exact error descriptions) enabled rapid turnaround.'

  - The QA agent's first action was running 'git diff main..HEAD' and correctly identified
    zero code changes, immediately signaling needs_revision. This fast-fail QA check
    prevented a false completion signal. QA agents should always verify source code
    changes exist before reviewing functionality, using git diff against the base
    branch as the first gate.

  - Implement a dedicated quality gate function (needs_resynthesis) that checks content
    against multiple criteria (XML tag detection, minimum word count) before accepting
    it. When content fails the gate, regenerate from structured metadata rather than
    attempting to patch bad input. This separates validation logic from generation
    logic cleanly.

  insights:
  - Despite the established direct-to-main mandate (8/8 success rate vs 0/9 for branch
    merges), the worktree-based workflow inherently creates a branch for the dev agent
    to commit to. The workflow infrastructure itself creates the conditions for the
    merge-drops-source failure mode. Workflow DSL needs to either commit directly
    to main or include an explicit merge-to-main step before signaling complete.

  insights:
  - QA agent's initial pytest run failed because dev dependencies weren't installed
    in QA's environment. The QA agent had to install deps before running tests. Workflows
    should ensure all agents share the same virtual environment or include environment
    setup as a prerequisite step, especially when QA needs to run the same test suite
    the dev agent created.
