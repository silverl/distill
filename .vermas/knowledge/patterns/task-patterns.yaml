  - Claude Code encodes project paths by replacing / with - (e.g., -Users-nikpatel-Documents-GitHub-vermas).
    Decoding requires a heuristic using known parent directory names (_KNOWN_PARENT_DIRS)
    to determine where the project name begins. The dev's approach of walking segments
    right-to-left until hitting a known parent is robust and handles hyphenated project
    names correctly. This pattern is reusable for any path-encoding scheme.

  insights:
  - Despite the established direct-to-main mandate (8/8 success rate vs 0/9 for branch
    merges), the worktree-based workflow inherently creates a branch for the dev agent
    to commit to. The workflow infrastructure itself creates the conditions for the
    merge-drops-source failure mode. Workflow DSL needs to either commit directly
    to main or include an explicit merge-to-main step before signaling complete.

  - QA agent's initial pytest run failed because dev dependencies weren't installed

    should ensure all agents share the same virtual environment or include environment
    setup as a prerequisite step, especially when QA needs to run the same test suite
    the dev agent created.

  insights:
  - A 213-second (3.5 minute) workflow duration for a task requiring code implementation,
    testing, and QA review is insufficient. The dev agent likely ran out of time or
    encountered an error before completing the commit cycle. Successful implementation
    tasks in this project typically require 10-30 minutes. Workflow orchestrators
    should set minimum duration thresholds based on task complexity.

  - Agents must commit code to the branch before signaling 'done' or before the workflow
    state machine transitions. A pre-signal verification check (pre-signal-check.sh)
    exists in this project but the agent either didn't run it or the workflow failed
    before reaching that stage. Enforcing commit-before-signal at the infrastructure
    level (not just agent-level) would prevent code loss from both timeout and crash
    scenarios.
