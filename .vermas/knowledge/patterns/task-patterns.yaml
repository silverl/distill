  insights:
  - Running pytest without --all-extras failed due to missing pytest-cov dependency
    from pyproject.toml addopts. Using 'uv run --all-extras pytest' ensures all optional
    test dependencies are available, preventing false failures in CI/QA verification.

  insights:
  - MCP 'Connection refused' errors can cause agents to fail silently without sending
    workflow signals. Monitor MCP server health and implement retry logic. Tmux session
    crashes combined with MCP issues lead to complete coordination failure even when
    code work is successful.

  insights:
  - The workflow completed in ~9 minutes with two dev-QA cycles. Each QA rejection
    included specific actionable feedback (exact error message, missing files, failing
    test command), and each dev signal included quantifiable proof (test counts, coverage
    percentage). This tight feedback loop enabled fast convergence.

  insights:
  - The dev agent initially investigated a 'failed' prior mission and discovered the
    code was complete but uncommitted. This debug meeting pattern - investigating
    artifacts before assuming failure - prevented duplicate work and identified the
    true root cause as orchestration issues.

  insights:
  - Workflows running over 10 minutes need active heartbeat monitoring to detect agent
    death before the full timeout. The dev agent died without signaling, causing the
    workflow to fail silently. Implementing periodic heartbeat checks (every 60-120
    seconds) would allow earlier detection and potential agent restart.

  insights:
  - When an agent dies mid-task, all progress is lost if no intermediate commits exist.
    Agents should checkpoint progress by committing partial work frequently (every
    significant change), enabling workflow resumption from the last checkpoint rather
    than restarting from scratch.

  insights:
  - The improvement logs indicate adding a 'validate' state before 'engineering' helps
    isolate environment/setup issues from implementation issues. Running a single-agent
    validation step first proves the execution environment works before spawning multiple
    agents, reducing complex failure modes.

  insights:
  - When a parser needs to handle multiple file formats (JSONL and JSON array/object),
    extracting format detection into a private _load_entries() method keeps the main
    parsing logic clean. The method auto-detects format and normalizes to a consistent
    data structure for downstream processing.

  insights:
  - When parsing JSON files that may come from different sources, support common wrapper
    patterns (objects with 'messages', 'entries', or 'conversation' keys) in addition
    to direct arrays. This makes the parser resilient to variations in how tools export
    session data.
