patterns:
- pattern: testing/*
  insights:
  - The dev agent ran 50 tests including integration tests covering the full pipeline
    and CLI exit codes before signaling done. This thorough testing approach gives
    high confidence that the implementation is correct, even when QA fails to review.

  insights:
  - Use Click's @click.group() decorator to create a main command that serves as a
    container for subcommands. This provides clean --help output, --version support,
    and extensible command structure. Each subcommand gets its own function with @main.command()
    decorator.

  insights:
  - QA agent approval message explicitly states which commands were run and passed
    ('uv run session-insights --help and uv run pytest passed'). This provides evidence-based
    approval rather than subjective assessment, making it clear what was verified.

    commands run to verify (e.g., ''uv run session-insights --help''), and test pass
    counts. This gives QA concrete verification steps and creates documentation.'

  insights:
  - MCP 'Connection refused' errors can cause agents to fail silently without sending
    workflow signals. Monitor MCP server health and implement retry logic. Tmux session
    crashes combined with MCP issues lead to complete coordination failure even when
    code work is successful.

  insights:
  - When agents fail to register with the workflow within a timeout period, the orchestrator
    should detect this early and log clear error messages. The root cause of this
    failure was agents never registering - checking tmux pane status after spawn could
    provide visibility into spawn failures.

    detailed signaling helps with workflow recovery and audit trails when issues occur.'

  insights:
  - QA agents should verify file existence independently of git status. Clean git
    status can mask uncommitted work that exists in the worktree. When reporting 'no
    implementation found', check both 'git status' AND file existence with ls/stat
    to provide accurate feedback.

  insights:
  - Structure pyproject.toml with core dependencies in [project.dependencies] and
    testing/linting tools in [project.optional-dependencies.dev]. Use 'uv run --extra
    dev pytest' for CI/QA verification. Configure tool settings (pytest, mypy, ruff)
    in the same file.
