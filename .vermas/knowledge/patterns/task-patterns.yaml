- pattern: testing/*
  insights:
  - When adding caches to prevent duplicate processing (like _vermas_parsed_dirs),
    always expose a reset_vermas_cache() function for test isolation. This allows
    integration tests to run independently without cross-contamination from cached
    state.

  - Use a SESSION_PATTERNS dictionary to register multiple source directories (.claude/,
    .codex/, .vermas/) with their corresponding parsers. The discover_sessions() function
    iterates over patterns, and parse_session_file() dispatches to the correct parser
    based on detected source type.

    when parsing VerMAS directories. The first review caught missing requirements,
    the second caught integration edge cases. This pattern of incremental refinement

    code and 581 lines of tests, both properly committed to the repository. Unlike
    previous cycles where code existed but wasn't committed, this workflow verified
    deliverables were tracked in git before signaling done.

  insights:
  - The pattern analyzer implementation uses an abstract BaseAnalyzer class with a
    required analyze() method, then implements three specialized analyzers (SuccessFailureAnalyzer,
    TimelineAnalyzer, CrossSessionCorrelator). This separation allows each analyzer
    to focus on one concern while sharing ID generation and common interfaces. A run_all_analyzers()
    convenience function orchestrates all analyzers and returns a unified InsightCollection.

  insights:
  - Workflows running over 10 minutes need active heartbeat monitoring to detect agent
    death before the full timeout. The dev agent died without signaling, causing the
    workflow to fail silently. Implementing periodic heartbeat checks (every 60-120
    seconds) would allow earlier detection and potential agent restart.

  insights:

    than restarting from scratch.

    (filter_by_type, filter_by_severity, high_priority property) that make consumers'
    code cleaner and more expressive than manual list filtering.

    already-parsed directories. Always expose a reset function (reset_vermas_cache())
    for test isolation to prevent cache pollution between test runs.
