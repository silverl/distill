  insights:
  - When integrating multiple specialized parsers (Claude, Codex, VerMAS), add a _convert_parser_session_to_base()
    function that maps parser-specific message formats to a common BaseSession.turns
    structure. This enables downstream features like --include-conversation to work
    uniformly across all sources without source-specific handling in display code.

    just checking that code runs. Earlier cycles failed because dev over-built beyond

  insights:
  - When an agent sends its final signal (done/approved/complete) and then terminates
    before the orchestrator acknowledges, the framework reports 'agents died' despite
    successful completion. The workflow recorded three successful signals (dev done
    at 14:04, QA approved at 14:06, watcher complete at 14:06) yet reported failure.
    Orchestrators should check for existing completion signals before declaring failure.
