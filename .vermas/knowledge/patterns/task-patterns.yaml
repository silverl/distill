  insights:
  - 50 unit tests passed but the CLI entrypoint was broken - the console_scripts entry
    in pyproject.toml pointed to a Typer callback function instead of the app object.
    Integration testing of the actual installed CLI command (not just function calls)
    is essential to catch configuration issues.

  insights:
  - Use Click's @click.group() decorator to create a main command that serves as a
    container for subcommands. This provides clean --help output, --version support,
    and extensible command structure. Each subcommand gets its own function with @main.command()
    decorator.

  - 'The QA agent correctly identified two substantive issues: (1) the console script
    entrypoint pointed to a callback function that doesn''t produce help output, and
    (2) discover_sessions incorrectly scanned .claude directory for codex sources
    instead of .codex. This demonstrates QA''s value in catching integration-level
    bugs that unit tests miss.'

    counts. This gives QA concrete verification steps and creates documentation.'

  insights:
  - MCP 'Connection refused' errors can cause agents to fail silently without sending
    workflow signals. Monitor MCP server health and implement retry logic. Tmux session
    crashes combined with MCP issues lead to complete coordination failure even when
    code work is successful.

  insights:
  - When agents fail to register with the workflow within a timeout period, the orchestrator
    should detect this early and log clear error messages. The root cause of this
    failure was agents never registering - checking tmux pane status after spawn could
    provide visibility into spawn failures.

  insights:
  - QA agents should verify file existence independently of git status. Clean git
    status can mask uncommitted work that exists in the worktree. When reporting 'no
    implementation found', check both 'git status' AND file existence with ls/stat
    to provide accurate feedback.
