  - 'When discovering sessions from multiple sources (claude, codex, vermas), scanning
    all directories for all sources causes duplicate entries and overwrites. The fix
    was to make discover_sessions() scan only source-specific directories: .claude
    for claude sessions, .codex for codex sessions, etc. This separation of concerns
    prevents data pollution.'

  insights:
  - When creating test fixtures with directory names that match project-wide gitignore
    rules (like .claude/), QA review will catch that the fixtures won't be tracked
    in version control. The dev-QA cycle identified that tests/fixtures/.claude/ was
    ignored by the blanket .claude/ rule, requiring either an exception (!tests/fixtures/.claude/)
    or renaming the fixture directory. Always check if fixture paths conflict with
    gitignore patterns.

  insights:
  - The QA agent used 'needs_revision' signal with detailed root cause analysis pointing
    to specific files and test names. This enabled the dev to fix the issue in under
    2 minutes. Including file paths (src/session_insights/core.py) and test names
    in revision feedback dramatically speeds up resolution.

    code and 581 lines of tests, both properly committed to the repository. Unlike
    previous cycles where code existed but wasn't committed, this workflow verified
    deliverables were tracked in git before signaling done.

  insights:
  - The pattern analyzer implementation uses an abstract BaseAnalyzer class with a
    required analyze() method, then implements three specialized analyzers (SuccessFailureAnalyzer,
    TimelineAnalyzer, CrossSessionCorrelator). This separation allows each analyzer
    to focus on one concern while sharing ID generation and common interfaces. A run_all_analyzers()
    convenience function orchestrates all analyzers and returns a unified InsightCollection.

  - Workflows running over 10 minutes need active heartbeat monitoring to detect agent
    death before the full timeout. The dev agent died without signaling, causing the
    workflow to fail silently. Implementing periodic heartbeat checks (every 60-120
    seconds) would allow earlier detection and potential agent restart.

  insights:

    Agents should checkpoint progress by committing partial work frequently (every

    than restarting from scratch.

    code cleaner and more expressive than manual list filtering.
