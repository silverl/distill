patterns:
- pattern: testing/*
  insights:
  - Test suite uses temporary directories with pytest fixtures to create realistic
    directory hierarchies (temp_dir fixture). Tests cover standard .claude structure,
    sessions/ subdirectory, mixed locations, and both .json and .jsonl extensions,
    ensuring parser handles all real-world variations.

  insights:
  - Parser uses multiple glob patterns (*.jsonl, *.json) to discover session files,
    and checks both direct locations and conventional subdirectories (sessions/).
    This pattern ensures backward compatibility while supporting evolving file structures.

  insights:
  - QA agent identified that parser only handled direct .jsonl files, missing the
    real Claude directory structure (.claude/projects/*/sessions/*.json). This demonstrates
    the value of domain-aware QA review that tests against actual usage patterns rather
    than just API contracts.

  insights:
  - MCP 'Connection refused' errors can cause agents to fail silently without sending
    workflow signals. Monitor MCP server health and implement retry logic. Tmux session
    crashes combined with MCP issues lead to complete coordination failure even when
    code work is successful.

  insights:
  - When agents fail to register with the workflow within a timeout period, the orchestrator
    should detect this early and log clear error messages. The root cause of this
    failure was agents never registering - checking tmux pane status after spawn could
    provide visibility into spawn failures.

  insights:
  - When using git worktrees for parallel development, pytest can pick up wrong module
    from another worktree's sys.path. QA agent discovered that explicit PYTHONPATH=src
    or editable install is required to ensure tests use the correct worktree's code.

  insights:
  - Workflows running over 10 minutes need active heartbeat monitoring to detect agent
    death before the full timeout. The dev agent died without signaling, causing the
    workflow to fail silently. Implementing periodic heartbeat checks (every 60-120
    seconds) would allow earlier detection and potential agent restart.

  insights:
  - When an agent dies mid-task, all progress is lost if no intermediate commits exist.
    Agents should checkpoint progress by committing partial work frequently (every
    significant change), enabling workflow resumption from the last checkpoint rather
    than restarting from scratch.

  insights:
  - The improvement logs indicate adding a 'validate' state before 'engineering' helps
    isolate environment/setup issues from implementation issues. Running a single-agent
    validation step first proves the execution environment works before spawning multiple
    agents, reducing complex failure modes.
