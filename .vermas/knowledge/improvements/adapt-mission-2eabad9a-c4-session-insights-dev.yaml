change: "Cycle 4 proved the mission is viable (30% -> 68% KPI jump) when tasks target\
  \ the right stack layer. The primary bottleneck is now note_content_richness at\
  \ 0%, which requires formatter/renderer work \u2014 not more parser work. The current\
  \ workflow's KPI section still says 'note_content_richness: 0% \u2014 CRITICAL'\
  \ but doesn't direct agents specifically toward the formatter layer, which is where\
  \ the gap actually is (parsers are complete per cycle-3-6 learning). Additionally:\
  \ (1) remove the deprecated flag since this is the active workflow, (2) update KPI\
  \ baselines to reflect cycle 4 progress, (3) add explicit guidance to NOT work on\
  \ parser layer (it's done), (4) add negative-path testing requirement for cli_runs_clean,\
  \ (5) increase reviewer timeout from 15m to 20m to allow thorough review of formatter\
  \ code which touches multiple output paths."
