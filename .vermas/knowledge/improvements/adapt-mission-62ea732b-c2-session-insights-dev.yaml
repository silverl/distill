change: 'The workflow lacks: 1) A validation state to catch environment issues that
  caused 100% failure in cycle 1, 2) A blocked state for graceful failure handling,
  3) RCA requirements before retrying failed work. Evidence shows repeated failures
  without root cause investigation. Adding validation upfront and blocked state addresses
  the ''fundamental execution blockers'' identified in cycle 1.'
