target: agent/engineer
change: The engineer agent instructions lack any guidance on handling repeated failures
  or decomposing complex tasks. Evidence shows 4+ consecutive zero-output cycles where
  the engineer attempted the same monolithic task each time. Adding explicit decomposition
  guidance and a diagnostic-first approach mirrors the only successful recovery pattern
  observed (cycle-3-5). Also adding guidance to validate progress against functional
  output, not just task closure, since 48 tasks were marked 'completed' with only
  15% KPI progress.
