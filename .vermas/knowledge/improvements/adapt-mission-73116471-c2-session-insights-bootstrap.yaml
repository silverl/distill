type: workflow_change
target: workflow/session-insights-bootstrap
change: The bootstrap workflow is one of 4 nearly-identical generic workflows lacking
  failure gates, KPI awareness, or blocked state handling. Evidence from cycle-2-8
  shows root cause analysis was skipped leading to repeated failures. Evidence from
  cycle-5-6 shows KPIs measuring wrong things. Adding the failure gate and KPI-awareness
  patterns from the updated session-insights-dev workflow. This is the same pattern
  applied to ensure consistency across all session-insights workflows.
