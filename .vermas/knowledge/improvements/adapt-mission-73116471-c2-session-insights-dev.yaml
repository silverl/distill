change: 'The deprecated session-insights-dev workflow has the best failure gate pattern
  but is marked deprecated. The active workflows (bootstrap, foundation, scaffold)
  lack any failure diagnosis, KPI-awareness, or task prioritization guidance. Evidence
  shows: (1) cycles wasted on testing while 4/5 KPIs stagnated, (2) repeated failures
  without root cause analysis (cycle-2-8 learning), (3) zero-progress loops that could
  have been caught earlier. This updated workflow un-deprecates session-insights-dev,
  integrates KPI-awareness into engineering instructions, adds a measurement-first
  principle for unmeasured KPIs, and tightens the review phase to check KPI impact.
  The failure gate from the original is preserved but made more actionable.'
