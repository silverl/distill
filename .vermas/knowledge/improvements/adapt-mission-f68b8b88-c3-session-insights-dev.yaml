change: The workflow lacks a 'blocked' signal path and specific guidance for complex
  parsing tasks. The implement-vermas-parser task has failed across multiple cycles.
  Adding a blocked state and more specific engineering instructions for parsing tasks
  will help agents signal infrastructure issues properly and provide better guidance
  for the failing task.
