change: 'The engineer agent lacks guidance on: 1) Handling failed tasks (RCA requirement),
  2) Verifying dependencies before working on dependent tasks, 3) Knowing when to
  signal blocked vs attempting fixes. Evidence shows cascading failures between parser/analyze-command
  and no RCA before retrying. Adding explicit dependency checking and RCA requirements.'
