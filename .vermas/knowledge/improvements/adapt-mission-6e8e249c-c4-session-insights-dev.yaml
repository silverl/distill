change: Evidence shows CLI tasks have >50% failure rate across cycles. The workflow
  lacks explicit guidance for handling CLI tasks which are identified as high-risk.
  Adding CLI-specific decomposition instructions and a blocked state with escalation
  criteria will help agents recognize when to signal blocked rather than repeatedly
  failing. The extended timeout for engineering (45m vs 30m) accounts for CLI complexity.
  The blocked state ensures failed patterns trigger proper escalation rather than
  infinite retries.
