change: "The evidence strongly supports three targeted changes: (1) note_content_richness\
  \ has had ZERO movement across all cycles and is explicitly called out as the weakest\
  \ KPI \u2014 the workflow instructions need to make the analyze subcommand the mandatory\
  \ first task, not just a priority suggestion. (2) Execution stalls were identified\
  \ as a scheduling problem where pending tasks exist but none are picked up \u2014\
  \ adding a pre-check forcing task pickup addresses this directly. (3) The CLI decomposition\
  \ pattern (parsing, dispatch, logic) has proven to produce zero failures across\
  \ two cycles \u2014 encoding it as a required practice in the workflow prevents\
  \ regression. These changes are conservative: they sharpen existing instructions\
  \ rather than restructuring the workflow."
