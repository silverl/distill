target: workflow/session-insights-dev
change: 100% task failure rate indicates environment/infrastructure issues. The workflow
  currently jumps directly to 'engineering' without any validation. Adding a 'validate'
  state as the first step will catch environment issues (missing Python, broken uv,
  missing project structure) BEFORE wasting cycles on implementation. This is the
  highest-impact change based on the evidence that all tasks failed without any meaningful
  progress.
