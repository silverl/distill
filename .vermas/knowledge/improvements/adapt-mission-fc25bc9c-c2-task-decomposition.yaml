target: prompt/task-decomposition
change: CLI implementation was identified as a high-risk area (cycle-4-6) and the
  CLI skeleton task has blocked all progress for 5+ cycles (cycle-5-4). The evidence
  shows that complex tasks need to be decomposed into smaller, independently completable
  units. This prompt provides guardrails for task decomposition, especially for CLI-related
  work which has a documented history of blocking entire missions.
