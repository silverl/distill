change: "The core problem is structural: 7+ cycles at 30-45% KPI progress with 80%\
  \ task completion rate means task selection is fundamentally misaligned with KPI\
  \ impact. The planning prompt must enforce three changes backed by strong evidence:\
  \ (1) one-KPI-per-task isolation (bundling caused attribution failures in cycle\
  \ 2), (2) mandatory root-cause analysis before retrying any failed task (skipping\
  \ RCA in cycle 2 led to repeated failures per cycle-2-8), and (3) task prioritization\
  \ by expected KPI delta rather than feasibility. Additionally, the narrative_quality_scorer\
  \ has been identified as the single highest-leverage blocker across multiple cycles\
  \ \u2014 it must be explicitly prioritized."
