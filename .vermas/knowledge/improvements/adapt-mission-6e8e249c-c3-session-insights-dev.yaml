target: workflow/session-insights-dev
change: Cycle 3 evaluation and learnings confirm foundation phase is complete. Current
  instructions still allow infrastructure/scaffolding tasks which yield only 1-2%
  KPI gain per task. Adding explicit directive to prioritize feature implementation
  (parsing logic, integration tests) should increase KPI impact from 5% to 10%+ per
  cycle. Also strengthening the CLI decomposition guidance based on cycle-4-6 learnings
  about CLI being high-risk.
