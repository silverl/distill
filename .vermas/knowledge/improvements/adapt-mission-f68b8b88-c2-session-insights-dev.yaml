change: The workflow currently jumps directly to engineering without validating the
  environment. Both cycles failed with 100% task failure rate because the execution
  environment was broken. Adding a mandatory 'validate' state that must pass before
  any implementation work begins will catch infrastructure issues early and prevent
  wasted cycles. The validate state includes explicit health checks for Python, uv,
  project structure, and pytest - all prerequisites that must work before implementation
  can succeed.
