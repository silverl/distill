target: workflow/session-insights-dev
change: 'The mission is stalled at 96% (46/48 tasks) with the remaining tasks failing
  repeatedly across multiple cycles. The current workflow lacks: (1) an automatic
  escalation mechanism after consecutive failures, (2) a way to skip or defer non-critical
  blocking tasks, and (3) pre-flight validation that checks whether a task has previously
  failed before retrying it with the same approach. The learnings explicitly state
  that ''autonomous retry loops on persistently failing tasks produce no value after
  2-3 attempts'' and that ''improvement suggestions are only valuable if mechanically
  enforced.'' This update adds a failure-tracking gate to the engineering instructions
  and explicitly addresses the negative-path-cli-tests blocker by instructing the
  agent to diagnose root cause before retrying.'
