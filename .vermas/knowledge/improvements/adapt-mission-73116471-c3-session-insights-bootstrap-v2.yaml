change: 'The current workflow lacks: (1) a blocked state for the engineer to signal
  infrastructure issues, causing stuck cycles; (2) any decomposition enforcement in
  the engineering state - the evidence shows monolithic ''core feature implementation''
  tasks fail repeatedly while decomposed tasks succeed (cycle-3-5 recovery pattern);
  (3) a revision limit to prevent infinite revision loops that produce zero output.
  Adding a blocked state, decomposition instructions, and a max-revision counter addresses
  the three primary failure modes observed across 4+ failed cycles.'
