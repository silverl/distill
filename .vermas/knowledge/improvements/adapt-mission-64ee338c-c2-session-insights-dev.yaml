change: 'The workflow currently jumps directly to engineering without validating the
  environment. Evidence shows 100% failure rate over 2 cycles with ''setup-project-structure''
  failing 3+ times. Learnings explicitly require diagnostic checks before directory
  creation: (1) verify cwd, (2) check write permissions, (3) check for conflicting
  files. Adding a mandatory ''diagnose'' state that MUST pass before engineering can
  proceed. This addresses the root cause identified in learnings.'
