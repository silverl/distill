target: workflow/session-insights-dev
change: The current workflow lacks failure diagnosis steps and attempts complex tasks
  without decomposition. Evidence shows 'implement-analyze-command' has failed 3+
  times without root cause analysis. Adding a mandatory diagnosis state after 2 failures
  and breaking the engineering phase into smaller checkpoints will prevent infinite
  retry loops. The validate state is good but the workflow needs explicit failure
  handling.
