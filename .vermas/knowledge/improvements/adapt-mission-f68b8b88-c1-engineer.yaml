change: The engineer agent prompt lacks guidance on what to do when encountering execution
  blockers. Adding explicit instructions to report failures immediately rather than
  continuing will help surface issues faster. Also adding guidance to validate prerequisites
  before starting work, which aligns with the 'setup-project-structure is a prerequisite'
  learning.
