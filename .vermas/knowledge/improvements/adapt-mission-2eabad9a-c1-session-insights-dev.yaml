change: 'The current workflow has improved CLI handling instructions but lacks explicit
  prioritization of note_content_richness (0% after 5+ cycles, highest-risk KPI) and
  doesn''t guide engineers to wire real data into existing skeletons rather than creating
  new scaffolding. The evaluation confirms skeleton code exists but isn''t functional.
  This modification adds: (1) explicit priority ordering for remaining work, (2) a
  ''wire real data first'' directive to prevent more scaffolding without integration,
  (3) note_content_richness as a must-address item, and (4) a test requirement for
  actual CLI invocations, not just unit tests.'
