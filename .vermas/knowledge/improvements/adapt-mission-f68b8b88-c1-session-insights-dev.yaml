change: 100% task failure rate with all three tasks failing indicates fundamental
  execution blockers. The workflow immediately jumps to 'engineering' without validating
  prerequisites. Adding a 'validate' state that runs before engineering will isolate
  environment/setup issues from implementation issues. The validation state uses a
  single agent (engineer) as recommended by learnings that suggest proving single-agent
  execution before multi-agent coordination. Also increased engineering timeout since
  the current execution capacity appears limited.
