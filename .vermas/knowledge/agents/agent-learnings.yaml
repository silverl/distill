agents:
  general:
    learnings:
    - "The dev agent successfully delivered real code in 2/7 tasks (wire-weekly +44\
      \ LOC, KPI test suite +257 LOC) but produced artifact-only commits for 3 fix\
      \ tasks and the final verification \u2014 a 29% real-code delivery rate."
    - The QA agent performed its gating role effectively by flagging the missing KPI_FINAL.md
      deliverable, but did not catch the 3 earlier artifact-only fix commits that
      had zero source changes.
    - "The watcher agent's role was invisible in the commit trail \u2014 no evidence\
      \ of workflow-level intervention when parallel tasks all produced artifact-only\
      \ commits, suggesting the watcher either lacked enforcement capability or did\
      \ not detect the pattern."
