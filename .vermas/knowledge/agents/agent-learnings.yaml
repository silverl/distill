    learnings:
    - 'Dev agent was highly effective: delivered 894 LOC across 11 files with 35 new
      tests (430 total passing) in under 7 minutes of active implementation, addressing
      all three stalled core features (narrative generation, project notes, weekly
      digests).'
    - "QA agent performed two reviews \u2014 an early premature review (correct but\
      \ noisy) and a thorough final review with independent test execution (uv run\
      \ --extra dev pytest). QA caught an environment issue (pytest-cov not in base\
      \ deps) and worked around it."
    - Watcher agent provided accurate situational awareness, correctly interpreting
      the early QA needs_revision as expected workflow ordering rather than a problem,
      and summarized the final state accurately.
