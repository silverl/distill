    learnings:
    - Dev agent completed implementation in ~6 minutes (07:59 to 08:06) including
      5 new/modified source files and 25 tests, showing efficient execution of well-scoped
      tasks.
    - "QA agent provided actionable, specific feedback \u2014 identifying the exact\
      \ function, the contradicting docstring, and requesting 3 specific test cases\
      \ \u2014 enabling a 3-minute fix turnaround rather than vague revision requests."
    - "The dev-QA signal-based interaction completed the full cycle (initial review\
      \ \u2192 revision \u2192 re-review \u2192 approval) in under 15 minutes with\
      \ 2 revision rounds, demonstrating efficient async coordination."
