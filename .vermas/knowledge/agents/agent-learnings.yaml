agents:
  general:
    learnings:
    - Dev agent correctly identified the task as already-complete rather than re-implementing,
      demonstrating good codebase awareness
    - QA agent properly ran full test suite (185 passed) but crashed after signaling,
      suggesting possible resource/timeout issue
    - Watcher agent successfully synthesized both dev and QA signals into workflow-complete
      status before orchestrator detected QA death
