    learnings:
    - Dev agent provided highly detailed 'done' signal messages that explained exactly
      what was fixed and why, enabling fast QA verification without additional back-and-forth
    - QA agent (Codex-based) efficiently ran pytest and confirmed changes, signaling
      'approved' in under 2 minutes after dev's done signal
    - Watcher agent successfully coordinated workflow completion, ensuring both dev
      and QA signals were captured before marking workflow complete
