    learnings:
    - Dev provided complete done signal with implementation details ('default=./insights/',
      directory creation, confirmation message) enabling efficient QA review without
      code archaeology
    - QA correctly identified test-spec misalignment in first review (needs_revision
      signal) rather than passing code that would fail in CI with outdated assertions
    - Both agents coordinated efficiently - total workflow time of 455s with single
      revision cycle demonstrates effective handoff protocol
