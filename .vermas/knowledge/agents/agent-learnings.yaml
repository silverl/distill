agents:
  general:
    learnings:
    - 'Dev agent performed well: completed implementation with 50 passing tests and
      clear completion signal in ~3.5 minutes of the workflow'
    - QA agent failed to even start or complete review phase - process died without
      producing any signals
    - Agent death occurred specifically in the QA role, suggesting potential issues
      with tmux pane management or agent spawning for secondary agents
