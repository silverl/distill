    learnings:
    - Dev agent completed the full implementation (+262/-18 LOC across 4 files with
      26 new tests) in approximately 6 minutes after receiving QA feedback, demonstrating
      efficient focused execution when given clear requirements.
    - QA agent identified the root cause (raw prompt passthrough without filtering)
      within 25 seconds of starting review, enabling the needs_revision signal before
      dev had begun implementation. Early QA involvement prevented wasted effort on
      wrong approaches.
    - Watcher agent provided a single progress update confirming all agents were registered
      and working, then stayed out of the way. Minimal watcher overhead is appropriate
      for short-duration workflows.
