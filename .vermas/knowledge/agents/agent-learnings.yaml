agents:
  general:
    learnings:
    - The dev agent successfully executed the analyze pipeline (generating 40+ files)
      but failed to extract and record the specific KPI measurements requested in
      the task definition, suggesting it focused on running commands rather than reading
      and acting on all task requirements.
    - The QA agent performed well by checking for the specific deliverable (KPI_BASELINE.md)
      and providing a clear, actionable rejection message rather than rubber-stamping
      the large commit.
    - "The watcher agent generated 159 events (more than dev's 136) indicating active\
      \ monitoring, but did not catch the missing deliverable before QA review \u2014\
      \ suggesting watchers monitor execution health rather than deliverable completeness."
