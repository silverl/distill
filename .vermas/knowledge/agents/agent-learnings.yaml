agents:
  general:
    learnings:
    - Dev agent demonstrated improved discovery behavior by checking existing state
      before attempting implementation, breaking the pattern of 4 consecutive cycles
      with 'planning without discovery' failures.
    - QA agent appropriately scoped verification to match actual work performed (ls
      checks only), avoiding unnecessary full test runs for verification-only tasks.
    - Watcher correctly identified workflow success and noted 'no intervention needed',
      demonstrating proper passive monitoring role.
