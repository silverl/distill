    learnings:
    - The dev agent's session was contaminated with a prior debug meeting about mission-b630c874,
      causing it to investigate an unrelated failure instead of focusing on the assigned
      fix-project-names-edge-cases task. Despite this, code was ultimately produced
      on the branch.
    - "QA agent (Codex-based) correctly identified the empty delivery with a needs_revision\
      \ signal, but the workflow still concluded as 'success' \u2014 indicating the\
      \ success classification may be based on workflow completion rather than code-on-main\
      \ verification."
    - The watcher agent produced 159 lines of trace but the workflow lacked a gate
      to verify source code reached main before marking success.
