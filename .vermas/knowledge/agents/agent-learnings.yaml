    learnings:
    - 'Dev agent showed strong adaptability: recognized Typer-based CLI existed despite
      task specifying Click, fixed the actual gap (entry point wiring with main()
      calling app()) rather than rewriting. This pragmatic approach delivered value
      in minimal time.'
    - 'QA agent (Codex) was effective for focused test verification: ran targeted
      test suite (11 tests) and verified 3 specific acceptance criteria. The different
      agent type (Codex vs Claude) provided genuine independence in verification.'
    - 'Watcher agent served as a reliable synchronization point: confirmed both dev
      and QA signals before the workflow progressed to completion. The watcher''s
      progress signal at 17:30 provided clear audit trail of the signal chain.'
