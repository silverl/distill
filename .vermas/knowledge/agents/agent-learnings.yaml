    learnings:
    - "Dev agent demonstrated resilience by recovering from a mid-implementation crash,\
      \ completing 135 LOC across 6 files including 110 lines of tests, but committed\
      \ to the worktree branch instead of main \u2014 continuing the 12-cycle pattern\
      \ of branch code not reaching main."
    - QA agent acted quickly and correctly, running git diff within the first 2 minutes
      and signaling needs_revision when no source changes were found. However, QA
      did not re-review after the dev completed work on the branch, allowing the task
      to be marked 'done' without verifying code was on main.
    - Watcher agent provided excellent observability with two well-timed signals (blocked
      at crash detection, progress during recovery), giving accurate file-level change
      tracking that could inform automated recovery decisions in future workflows.
