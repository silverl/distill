    learnings:
    - "The dev agent initially submitted incomplete work missing 6 required fields,\
      \ but responded to QA feedback quickly (under 6 minutes) and delivered a complete\
      \ solution on the second attempt \u2014 suggesting dev agents benefit from explicit\
      \ field checklists in task descriptions."
    - The QA agent performed thorough structural review, verifying not just that tests
      passed but that specific required fields were present in the model definition
      and that downstream modules (formatter, imports) were updated correctly.
    - This was the first workflow in 8 attempts to successfully land code on main
      without merge-drops-source failure, suggesting the direct-commit-to-main approach
      (vs branch-then-merge) is more reliable for the current agent toolchain.
