agents:
  general:
    learnings:
    - Dev agent responded efficiently to QA feedback, addressing all three uncovered
      modules in a single implementation pass rather than incrementally fixing one
      at a time, which minimized round-trips.
    - QA agent provided precise, quantitative feedback (88% coverage, named the 3
      zero-coverage modules, specified the correct command with --extra dev flag),
      which eliminated ambiguity and enabled rapid dev response.
    - "The watcher agent's role in this workflow was minimal \u2014 the dev-QA coordination\
      \ was tight enough that external monitoring added little value for a focused\
      \ testing task."
