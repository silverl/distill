agents:
  general:
    learnings:
    - Dev agent terminated unexpectedly during a Pydantic model fix task, suggesting
      either resource exhaustion or a blocking operation that caused the CLI to exit
    - The watcher agent pattern (separate agent monitoring workflow progress) was
      active but couldn't prevent the workflow failure once the dev agent died
    - Multi-agent workflows on VerMAS are vulnerable to single-agent failures - no
      automatic recovery mechanism exists
