    learnings:
    - Dev agent produces high-quality code consistently - the analyze subcommand implementation
      (+611 LOC with comprehensive tests) demonstrates strong technical execution.
      The failure is purely in the merge/delivery step, not in code quality.
    - 'The workflow''s ''watcher'' agent failed to catch the merge-drops-source issue
      despite this being documented as the #1 systemic problem. Either the watcher
      lacks the tooling to verify main branch state post-completion, or its checks
      are insufficient.'
    - QA agent's review framework (from prior cycles) correctly identifies this pattern
      when reviewing, but the detection happens post-hoc rather than preventing the
      issue. Moving the check to a pre-signal gate would be more effective.
