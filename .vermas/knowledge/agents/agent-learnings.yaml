agents:
  general:
    learnings:
    - Dev agent executed for 12 minutes before failing, suggesting it was actively
      working when the process died rather than being stuck or blocked
    - No signals or intermediate progress were captured, indicating the agent may
      not have reached any checkpoint or signaling point before death
    - The 'implement-claude-parser' task was already marked as done in a previous
      cycle, suggesting this was a redundant re-execution that may have conflicted
      with existing work
