    learnings:
    - The dev agent produced substantive code (~256 LOC across 5 files including a
      new narrative_quality.py measurer) but failed to commit any of it to the branch,
      repeating the 'uncommitted-completion' pattern seen in M2e-C5.
    - The QA agent for the related final-kpi-verification task correctly identified
      missing deliverables (KPI_FINAL.md) and signaled needs_revision, showing QA
      gates are functioning even when dev execution fails.
    - "The worktree branch HEAD matches main's HEAD (23490885 'Planning workflow artifacts'),\
      \ confirming zero commits were made by the dev agent on its task branch \u2014\
      \ only planning artifacts exist."
