agents:
  general:
    learnings:
    - Dev agent completed substantial implementation (cli.py with 237 lines, core.py
      with 299 lines, integration test) but failed at the critical commit step
    - QA agent correctly identified the missing implementation by running tests and
      checking for expected files, but couldn't diagnose the root cause (uncommitted
      files vs missing code)
    - The workflow lacks a validation step between dev 'done' signal and QA start
      to verify commits exist
