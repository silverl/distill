    learnings:
    - "Dev agent responded effectively to QA's needs_revision signal, completing all\
      \ required changes (new section names, core.py integration, CLI wiring, 28 tests)\
      \ in a single revision round of approximately 5 minutes \u2014 demonstrating\
      \ that specific QA feedback enables fast turnaround."
    - QA agent (Codex) provided high-quality, actionable feedback identifying both
      functional gaps (missing sections, no CLI/core wiring) and environmental issues
      (missing pytest-cov), enabling the dev to address everything in one pass without
      back-and-forth.
    - Watcher agent observed the workflow but the dev agent's session was loaded with
      context from an unrelated debug meeting (mission-b630c874), suggesting the session
      management system doesn't provide clean isolation between tasks.
