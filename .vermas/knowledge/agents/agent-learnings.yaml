agents:
  general:
    learnings:
    - Dev agent responded quickly to QA feedback, implementing JSON format support
      with 4 additional tests in under 5 minutes after revision request
    - QA agent correctly identified the missing implementation in first review (files
      not present) rather than just running tests, showing proper verification order
    - QA agent provided precise error messages ('list' object has no attribute 'get')
      that pinpointed exact failure mode, enabling targeted fix
