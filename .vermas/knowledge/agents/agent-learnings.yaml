agents:
  general:
    learnings:
    - Dev agent successfully implemented all required functionality (cli.py, core.py,
      test_integration.py) but failed at the critical commit step, losing all progress
    - QA agent correctly identified missing implementation by running tests and checking
      file paths, providing specific technical feedback about what was missing
    - The dev agent may have run out of context/turns before completing the commit
      step, suggesting complex tasks need better checkpointing
