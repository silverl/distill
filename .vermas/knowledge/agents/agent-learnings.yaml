    learnings:
    - 'Dev agent was highly effective at implementation: +375 LOC of genuine code
      with 232 tests passing at 99% coverage on the formatter module. Dev proactively
      addressed edge cases (message truncation, max 5 questions, include_conversation
      flag) before QA review.'
    - "QA agent provided fast, specific feedback (21 seconds after dev's done signal)\
      \ identifying two concrete test names and a dependency issue. However, the flagged\
      \ issues turned out to already be fixed \u2014 suggesting QA may have analyzed\
      \ code statically without running all tests first, then corrected after verification."
    - "Watcher/merge agent continues to be the systemic failure point: it creates\
      \ artifact-only commits on main while the real code sits on task branches. This\
      \ is the 6th documented occurrence and the core blocker for the project \u2014\
      \ all the dev and QA quality is wasted if code never reaches main."
