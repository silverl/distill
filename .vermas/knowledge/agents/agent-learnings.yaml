    learnings:
    - No agent events or signals were recorded for this workflow, indicating failure
      occurred before the agent could establish communication with the orchestrator
    - Similar workflows (mission-62ea732b, mission-64ee338c) in cycle-2 succeeded
      with dev signals, suggesting this was an intermittent infrastructure or initialization
      issue rather than a code defect
