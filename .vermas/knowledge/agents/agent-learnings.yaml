agents:
  general:
    learnings:
    - "Dev agent was highly productive \u2014 created 716 LOC (39 tests across 6 categories)\
      \ and committed within a few minutes, with comprehensive signal metadata describing\
      \ all test coverage areas."
    - QA agent performed thorough verification (reviewed code, ran tests, confirmed
      requirements coverage) in only 3 minutes, though was initially blocked by missing
      dev dependencies in its environment.
    - Watcher agent correctly assessed the workflow as successful despite the eventual
      DSL-level failure classification, indicating good observational judgment but
      inability to prevent the tmux session death.
