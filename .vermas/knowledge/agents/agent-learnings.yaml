agents:
  general:
    learnings:
    - Dev agent completed implementation with 50 passing tests and detailed completion
      signal - good performance
    - QA agent successfully identified substantive issues (entrypoint config, discovery
      logic) but died after signaling needs_revision
    - QA death occurred after productive review work, suggesting tmux session instability
      rather than agent task failure
