    learnings:
    - QA (Codex agent) was thorough in identifying not just missing features but also
      integration edge cases like empty conversations and duplicate sessions
    - Dev responded quickly to QA feedback with targeted fixes rather than wholesale
      rewrites, demonstrating efficient iteration
    - Watcher agent provided useful workflow summary but was largely passive during
      the dev-qa cycle
