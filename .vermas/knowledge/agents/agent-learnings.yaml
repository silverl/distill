    learnings:
    - Dev agent produced substantial, well-structured code (2000 lines) but failed
      at the final merge step, indicating strong coding ability but gaps in workflow
      completion
    - The workflow marked success despite code never reaching main, suggesting the
      QA/verification step either didn't run or didn't check the right thing
    - Test infrastructure was properly set up with fixtures and comprehensive test
      classes, showing good testing discipline
