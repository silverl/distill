    learnings:
    - Dev agent (claude) responded effectively to QA feedback, making targeted changes
      to key decisions extraction logic and adding exactly the missing test coverage
      identified by QA, completing revision in under 3 minutes.
    - QA agent (codex) provided actionable, specific feedback identifying both requirement
      gaps and environment issues (missing pytest-cov), enabling the dev to address
      all concerns in a single revision round.
    - The workflow achieved its stated goal (project note generation with all required
      sections) but the merge mechanism still failed to preserve source changes on
      main, indicating the worktree-based workflow doesn't enforce the direct-to-main
      mandate from MEMORY.md.
