message: 'Achieved 99% test coverage (target was 90%). Added 30 new tests covering:

  - CLI analyze command full pipeline including date filtering, source filters, error
  handling

  - core.py JSON array parsing, ISO timestamp handling, summary truncation, blank
  line handling

  - obsidian.py long content truncation, templates duration formatting edge cases

  - claude.py tool result list content, assistant string content, invalid timestamps


  Added # pragma: no cover comments for intentionally uncovered code:

  - __main__.py entry point (only executes when running python -m session_insights)

  - cli.py if __name__ == "__main__" block


  117 tests passing, coverage improved from 83% to 99%.'
