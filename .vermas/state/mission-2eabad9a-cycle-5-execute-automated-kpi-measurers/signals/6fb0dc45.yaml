message: 'QA found requirement gaps: note_content_richness should run CLI + parse
  generated note files (current code formats sessions directly), and vermas_task_visibility
  should parse generated notes (current code checks BaseSession fields). Also timestamp
  check uses `start_time:` which doesn''t exist in Obsidian notes. Tests: `pytest

  failed (PYTHONPATH not set), `PYTHONPATH=src pytest -q -o addopts='''' tests/measurers`
