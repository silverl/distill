message: 'QA review: blocking issue in project detection. derive_project_from_cwd
  still treats home dirs as valid projects. For cwd like `/Users/dev` or `/home/user`,
  it returns the username; `~` expands to home and returns username. This contradicts
  task note that prior logic fails for home dirs and the function docstring (step
  1 says return "" for `~`). Update `src/session_insights/parsers/project_utils.py`
  to treat home dir paths as invalid (return ""), add tests for `/Users/<name>`, `/home/<name>`,
  and `~`. Then adjust measurer eligibility/sample data as needed so KPI stays >=90%
  if home dirs are excluded. After changes, rerun tests.'
