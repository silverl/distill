message: Review found spec mismatches and missing weekly digest generation wiring.
  Formatter outputs old sections (Overview/Accomplishments/etc.) and lacks What Got
  Done/Challenges/Tools & Techniques/Projects Touched extraction. No CLI/core path
  writes weekly/ outputs. Tests only cover old format. pytest run failed due to missing
  pytest-cov.
