# project-foundation

Prior cycles failed because tasks assumed existing code. Breaking into ultra-small tasks: (1) create directories only, (2) minimal CLI that just runs, (3) minimal test that passes, (4) add command stub. Each task is independently verifiable. Using session-insights squad with engineer+reviewer roles. The session-insights-dev workflow provides proper review cycle. Tasks are sequentially dependent since each builds on the previous.
