# deliver-measurable-kpi-outputs

Cycle 4 regressed from 55% to 45% because it was pure infrastructure with no feature delivery. The prior evaluation explicitly demands: (1) at least one measured KPI value, (2) direct feature work not just measurement capability, and (3) focus on project_detection and tests_pass as closest to target. This plan front-loads project detection (the most achievable KPI), then parallelizes project notes and weekly digests (targeting the two furthest-from-target KPIs), and finishes with a comprehensive KPI measurement task. All 4 tasks produce direct, measurable output rather than infrastructure. Using 'session-insights' squad as it's the most mature squad for this mission domain. Tasks 2 and 3 are independent and can run in parallel after task 1 completes.
