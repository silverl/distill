Mission context:
# Mission: Project-Based Narrative Insights

The session-insights tool generates raw session notes (13k+ files). These are data dumps - useful for search but not human-readable narratives. Transform them into meaningful project-based insights that tell the story of what was built.

## Current State

Raw session notes contain:
- Session ID, timestamp, duration
- Tools used (Bash: 54, Read: 27, Edit: 13...)
- Outcomes (Modified 15 files, Ran 54 commands)
- Auto-tags (#debugging, #feature, #testing
