# Achieve 90% Test Coverage Target

Run pytest --cov=session_insights --cov-report=html to identify coverage gaps. Add missing tests for: cli.py argument handling and error paths, core.py pattern detection edge cases, obsidian.py template edge cases. Target minimum 90% line coverage as per mission KPI. Document any intentionally uncovered code (if any) with # pragma: no cover comments with justification.
