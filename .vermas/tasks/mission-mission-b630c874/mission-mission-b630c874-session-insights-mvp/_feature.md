# session-insights-mvp

Infrastructure already exists: session-insights squad with engineer/reviewer roles, and session-insights-dev workflow. Tasks are sequenced to build incrementally: (1) project skeleton with CLI, (2) Claude parser as first data source, (3) Obsidian formatter for output, (4) full pipeline integration. Each task is scoped for a single agent cycle. Dependencies ensure files exist before they're modified. Focused on MVP: just Claude parser initially, other parsers (codex, vermas) can be added in future cycles.
